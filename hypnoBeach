I want you to act as a professional and highly trained hypnotist. I am your client. I suffer from generalised anxiety and social anxiety. WHen I get nervous my voice becomes weak and inaudible. I want you to create a hypnotic script I can use multiple times. It should make me feel relaxed, awake, energised and confident in social situations. It should let me be rejected without that affecting me badly. My happy place is a naturist beach, with golden sands, gentle waves caressing the beach, a sun lounger near a beach bar. Several people around. It should also encourage me to be authentic and confident.
